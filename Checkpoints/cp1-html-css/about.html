          My name is Zihan Sheng. I am a first-year master's student at Duke University studying
          electrical and computer engineering. Before that, I earned my bachelor's degree in
          economics from Central University of Finance and Economics. I have also been to UCLA and
          some other prestigious institutions for short-term academic programs. Right now, I am
          here at UW to study CSE154. Why choose this course? Because web programming is awesome!

              This is a classic intro course for computer architecture. In Berkeley, this is the third
              and final course in the intro to CS series. The course comprehends many key components
              from software to hardware. Even though you may not want to be a hardware engineer, you
              still had better get yourself familiar with computer architecture, to improve the software
              performance most cost-effectively. Personally, I can't miss the one-stop chance to learn
              computer architecture knowledge. Additionally, the lecturer of this course, Dan Garcia,
              could be the best professor I have ever met.

              The subsequent course for CSE 142. After learning the most basic programming ideas and
              techniques in CSE 142, this course turns to teaching several fundamental data structures
              and algorithms. Besides, I can feel that the code I write for each programming assignment
              is getting longer and more complicated than CSE 142. Therefore, no matter for practice or
              theory learning, CSE 143 is a must-have course. BTW, the lecturer, Stuart Reges, delivered
              the lecture in the classroom like a normal class. That's a big plus. I sincerely appreciate
              his professionlism and kindness.

            <p>
              I feel a bit surprised when I found that UW offers this web programming course since most
              universities on the same level don't set a specific course for this topic. Some people
              argue that computer science education in university should focus on the most general CS
              theory, rather than teaching how to build a very specific application. That claim makes
              sense, but CSE 154 is more than just web programming. The ultimate object is full-stack
              development. In addition, we have to learn many languages in a short time and compose
              many sections together methodically. Those skills are necessary for software engineers.

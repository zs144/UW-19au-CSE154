The life of a traveling merchant is a lonely one, a fact with which Kraft Lawrence is well acquainted. Wandering from town to town with just his horse, cart, and whatever wares have come his way, the peddler has pretty well settled into his routine--that is, until the night Lawrence he happens upon a wolf goddess named Holo, claiming to be the Wisewolf of Yoitsu. Holo has wearied of life in the countryside and strikes up a bargain with the merchant. Lawrence agrees to accompany her to her homeland in exchange for assistance on his travels. She will lend him her cunning to increase his profits, while Lawrence will take her on a tour of human societies along the way. He soon learns, though, that having an ancient goddess as a traveling companion can be a mixed blessing.

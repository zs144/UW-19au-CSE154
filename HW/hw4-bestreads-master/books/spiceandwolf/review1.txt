A well written story with compelling characters. The real strength of this story is the realistic development of the dynamic between the two protagonists. The world building is done with great skill, showing a world very similar to our own in the late middle ages/early Renaissance, with a powerful but corrupt church and a complex economy where various kingdoms compete for prominence in the markets as well as battlefields.

# Homework 4 - Bestreads - Project Specification

*Special thanks to Allison Obourn for the original version of this assignment. Additional thanks to
Tal Wolman and Jack Venberg for the adaptation of this assignment into Node.js*

## Overview
This assignment focuses on implementing a web service in Node.js with Express and then using AJAX from a client JS program to retrieve data from it. The web service you implement will generate a variety of data about different books depending on the parameters it is sent. The client-side JS you will implement will make requests to this service and use the responses to update pages on your site.

### Learning Objectives
* Continue to practice all of the CSE 154 learning objectives from previous assignments, including:
    * Carefully reading and following assignment specifications, and more broadly, webpage
specifications given visual and text-based artifacts as a design basis.
    * Reducing redundancy in your code while producing expected output.
    * Listening and responding to user events using JS event handlers on DOM objects.
    * Modifying your web page using JS and DOM objects.
    * Producing quality readable and maintainable code with unobtrusive modular JavaScript.
    * Clearly documenting your code using JSDoc conventions as specified in the CSE 154 Code Quality Guide.
    * Fetch plain text and JSON data from a web service using AJAX with `fetch`.
    * Implement toggling between view states using JS and provided CSS helper classes
* Building an API that responds to GET requests using Node.js and Express.
* Using Node.js with `fs` and `glob` to read information from the server's file system.
* Handling different types of errors on the client and server.

### Starter Files and Final Deliverables

In this HW4 repository you will find the following starter files and directories:

| File/folders | Repository files to stay unchanged |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| `public/bestreads.html` |  The HTML file for the Bestreads website.|
| `public/bestreads.css`  |  The stylesheet for `bestreads.html`. |
| `public/covers/`  | All book cover images used to display on the webpage. |
| `public/images/`        | All other images used by the `HTML` and `CSS` for the webpage. |
| `books/`         | The books directory with all of the details and review files.|
| `.gitignore` | A file provided to ignore `node_modules` when pushing your code to GitLab |

The  `bestreads.html`, `bestreads.css`, `covers`, and `images` starter files are located inside of a `public` subdirectory inside of your repository. This allows you to serve these files to the client from your server. Everything outside of that directory, the client cannot access. You should not change the provided directory structure. Your repository should be submitted with these (**unchanged**) starter files as well as the following files you are responsible for creating:

| File          | Repository file you will implement and turn in |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| `package.json` | The JSON file with your project dependencies (e.g. `express`) which you initialize with `npm init` |
| `app.js` |The Node.js service that will supply the book data. |
| `public/bestreads.js`  | The JavaScript that will request the information from `app.js` and populate it into `bestreads.html`. |

**Important Note**: Make sure to never directly edit the `package.json` to ensure we can install the `node_modules` necessary for your solution.

The `app.js` file  should be saved at the root of this directory (at the same level as `public` and `books`). Your solution will be graded only on `app.js` and `bestreads.js`. Any changes you make to `bestreads.html`, `bestreads.css`, the `covers` subdirectory or the `books` subdirectory will not be eligible for full credit.

## External Requirements
Your webpage should match the overall appearance/behavior of the provided screenshots and it **must** match the appearance/behavior specified in this document.

When the page loads it should display the images and titles of each book for which you have data in a grid-like collection of selectable books (with covers and title) as depicted in Figure 1. The interface for this page is fairly straightforward: When the mouse hovers over a book on the main page, the cursor should turn to a pointer indicating that the user may click on that title by adding the provided `.selectable` CSS class. Clicking on any portion of a book cover (the title, image or rectangle container) hides the `#all-books` section, using the provided `.hidden` CSS class, and it will show the book details page (contained in the `#single-book` section). The `#single-book` section will be populated with all of the information about that book, as shown in Figure 2.

If the Home button in the upper right corner of the screen is clicked, the user will be returned to the `#all-books` view by hiding the `#single-book` and showing the `#all-books` view.

</p>
Figure 2: Bestreads single book image page (rendered in Chrome on Mac OSX)

The information displayed on these pages will be retrieved through `GET` requests to the API you create.  You should send a request to the server for data for this book and display its cover image, title, author, description and reviews. Based on the reviews, you will also set the overall rating for the book.

If at any time there is an error, the entire `#book-data` section (which contains both the `#all-books` and `#single-book` sections) should be hidden, the `#error-text` should be shown, and the Home button should be disabled. Note that on this particular client-side use of the Bestreads API, it doesn't make sense to tell a user of the website what type of error occurred, so we have a generic message included in the HTML that is hidden with the `hidden` class, but should be shown whenever an error occurs (whether it is the 400 or 500 error code). The expected view when an error occurs is shown in Figure 3 below.

## Bestreads API Overview
The `books` subdirectory contained in this repository will contain the data files for the books returned by your Bestreads API. This subdirectory must be in the same directory level as your `app.js` file. This will allow you to use relative paths to the files in each directory for `app.js`, such as `books/harrypotter/info.txt`. The `covers` subdirectory will be in the same `public` directory as your HTML, CS, and client-side JS files. This will allow you to use relative paths for the images in your front-end files such as `covers/wizardofoz.jpg`. This will be necessary in order for your site to function properly when turned in.

Each book is stored in a subdirectory in the `books` directory named after their `book_id`. Each subdirectory for books follow a strict lowercase naming convention with no spaces.

For example, the book with `book_id` `harrypotter` stores its files in a folder named
`books/harrypotter/`. This folder will contain the following text files:
  * `description.txt`
  * `info.txt`
  * A collection of numbered review files: `review1.txt`, `review2.txt`, ... (the number of reviews may vary).

You are to retrieve the book details (based on the request endpoint: `description`, `info`, or `reviews`) in the subdirectory corresponding to a given `:book_id` parameter.

### Bestreads API Implementation Details
Your API will have support for four different GET endpoints: `bestreads/description/:book_id`, `bestreads/info/:book_id`, `bestreads/reviews/:book_id`, or `bestreads/books`, depending on what information a client wants to retrieve. The value of `:book_id` should be a string representing a single book directory. For example, the `book_id` for the book "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Harry Potter #3)" is simply `harrypotter` (which is the name of the folder). An example `GET` request might be:

```
/bestreads/description/harrypotter
```

The Bestreads API will use Node.js with the `express` module to support requests from your client JS. For full credit, you must:
* Serve the `public` directory as static files using the following:

```
app.use(express.static("public"));
```

This line should be located at the top of the file, just underneath your module `const`s.

* Use the following lines at the bottom of your file to listen to the correct port:
```
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8000;
app.listen(PORT);
```
You will then be able to access your front-end from `localhost:8000/bestreads.html`.

### Bestreads API Request Details
Your `app.js` web service will provide different data based upon the route. The possible endpoints are described below:

#### Endpoint 1: Get a bookâ€™s description
**Request Format:** `/bestreads/description/:book_id`  
**Request Type:** `GET`  
**Returned Data Format:** plain text  
**Description:** . Your service should locate the file called `description.txt` for the given book subdirectory (using `:book_id`), and output the entire contents as plain text.  
**Example Request:** `/bestreads/description/harrypotter`  
**Example Output:**
```
Harry Potter is lucky to reach the age of thirteen, since he has already survived
the murderous attacks of the feared Dark Lord on more than one occasion. But his
hopes for a quiet term concentrating on Quidditch are dashed when a maniacal
mass-murderer escapes from Azkaban, pursued by the soul-sucking Dementors who
guard the prison. It's assumed that Hogwarts is the safest place for Harry to
be. But is it a coincidence that he can feel eyes watching him in the dark,
and should he be taking Professor Trelawney's ghoulish predictions seriously?
```

#### Endpoint 2: Get a bookâ€™s information
**Request Format:** `/bestreads/info/:book_id`  
**Request Type:** `GET`  
**Returned Data Format:** JSON  
**Description:** Your service should output the contents of `info.txt`, a file with two lines of information about the book: its title and author in JSON format.  
**Example Request:** `/bestreads/info/harrypotter`  
**Example Output:**

```json
{
  "title": "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Harry Potter #3)",
  "author": "by J.K. Rowling, Mary GrandPre (Illustrator)",
}
```

#### Endpoint 3: Get a bookâ€™s reviews
**Request Format:** `/bestreads/reviews/:book_id`  
**Request Type:** `GET`  
**Returned Data Format:** JSON  
**Description:** Output an array (in JSON form) containing all of the reviews for the book, the review rating, and the name of the reviewer *in the order of the review filename numbers*. The reviews are stored in files called `review1.txt`, `review2.txt`, etc. Each file contains one review for each book which is exactly three lines: The reviewerâ€™s name, the number of stars they gave the book (stored as a number and not a string) and their review. If a book has 10 or more reviews, the names will be e.g. `review01.txt`, .... So donâ€™t hard-code file names like "`review1.txt`"; instead, look for all files that begin with "`review`" and end with "`.txt`".  
**Example Request:** `/bestreads/reviews/harrypotter`  
**Example Output:**
```json
[
    {
        "name": "Wil Wheaton",
        "rating": 4.1,
        "text": "I'm beginning to wonder if there will ever be a Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher who is just a teacher."
    },
    {
        "name": "Zoe",
        "rating": 4.8,
        "text": "Yup yup yup I love this book"
    },
    {
        "name": "Kiki",
        "rating": 5,
        "text": "Literally one of the best books I've ever read. I was chained to it for two days. I cried and laughed and yelled AHH when all of the action went down."
    }
]
```

#### Endpoint 4: Get the list of all books
**Request Format:** `/bestreads/books`  
**Request Type:** `GET`  
**Returned Data Format:** JSON  
**Description:** Outputs JSON containing the titles and book_ids for each of the books that you have data for *in the order of book_ids alphabetically*. Find all the books inside the books folder, and build JSON containing information about each one. Your overall JSON object should have one field `"books"` that points to an array of books. Each book should be represented by an **object** with two properties: `title`, and `book_id`. **Youâ€™ll need to extract the title of the book from the bookâ€™s `info.txt`**. The `book_id` property should be set to the name of the folder that contains the resources about that particular book.  
**Example Request:** `/bestreads/books`  
**Example Output:** (abbreviated)  
```json
{
    "books": [
        {
            "title": "2001: A Space Odyssey",
            "book_id": "2001spaceodyssey"
        },
        {
            "title": "Alanna: The First Adventure (Song of the Lioness #1)",
            "book_id": "alannathefirstadventure"
        },
        {
            "title": "Alice in Wonderland",
            "book_id": "aliceinwonderland"
        },
        ... (one entry like this for each folder inside books/)
    ]
}
```
#### Handling Invalid Requests
Your web service should handle invalid requests with a 400 (Invalid Request) status code. The only invalid request you need to handle is if a given `book_id` parameter does not correspond to a book folder in the `books` directory. Remember that you use the `ENOENT` error code to check whether a thrown error is due to specifically to a file/directory not being found (such as for a path using the value of the `<book_id>` parameter as a book directory name).  

If no data exists for the given `book_id`, the 400 error should be sent with the **in plain text** message:

  `"No results found for <book_id>."`

replacing `<book_id>` with the parameter passed (maintaining original letter-casing). No other output should be produced.

Note that if you use `glob`, an empty result array for a given path pattern to a particular book's review files also indicates that the book does not exist. No error will occur if the path pattern passed to glob does not match any existing files - make sure to handle this appropriately.

### Handling Server-side Errors
If any error occurs with a file-processing function that is _not_ due to an invalid `book_id` parameter (handled above), it must be handled with a 500 (Internal Server Error) status code sent with the plain text message:

  `"Something went on the server, try again later."`

### Client-side JavaScript Details
Your `bestreads.js` will use AJAX `fetch` to request data from your Node.js Bestreads API and insert it into `bestreads.html`. Your page should have the following functionality:

* When the page loads it should request all of the books (`/bestreads/books`) from the Bestreads API. It should display each of these books by adding the image of the books cover (in a `img` tag) and the books title (in a `p` tag) *directly* into a `div` and adding that `div` *directly* to the `#all-books` section already on the page *in the order that they are returned from the API*. The `#single-book` section should be hidden. The `.hidden` class is provided in `bestreads.css`.

* **Note**: Only one listing for each book returned by the API should appear on the page.

* As mentioned previously, it should be apparent to the user that they can click on a book. Thus the cursor should turn to a pointer when the user's mouse is hovering over either a book cover, title, or container. To assist you we have provided the `.selectable` class in `bestreads.css` which you should add to the created book elements.

* When a user clicks on a book cover, or title of a book, or the container holding both, the  `#all-books` section should be hidden and the `#single-book` section should be shown. You should then request the info, description and reviews for that book from the server. The title and author retrieved from the info and the description requests, should be inserted into the `#book-title`, `#book-author`, and `#book-description` elements in the `#single-book` section (replacing any information from a previously-selected book).  

* For the reviews, you will need to create elements to append information for each review *directly* in the `#book-reviews` section of the page *in the order that they are returned from the API*:
  * The name of the reviewer and should be placed into an `h3`.
  * The rating of the review should be placed in an `h4` prepended with `"Rating: "`. For example if a
  review had a rating of 4.3 from a reviewer, the second line of the review would display:
  ```
  Rating: 4.3
  ```
  * The text of the review should be inserted into a `p` element.
  * The `h3`, `h4`, and the `p` must be appended _directly_ into the `#book-reviews` section.
* You will also need to calculate and display the value for the `#book-rating` element of the `#single-book` section. This can be accomplished by averaging the ratings from each review (above). You may assume all books have at least one review for the purposes of this calculation.

**Details about Rating Formats:**  
The ratings returned from the web service are not guaranteed to be formatted consistently (for example, a rating for one review may be 3 and the rating for another review may be 3.0). All ratings (`#book-rating` and the `h4` for each review rating) should be displayed consistently on the bestreads website rounded to 1 decimal place. For example, `3.72` should be rounded to `3.7`. This includes whole numbers, for example if the average is 3, it should be displayed as `3.0`.

To accomplish this formatting for all ratings, including the average, (for the `#book-rating`, make sure to format _after_ calculating the average), you should use the [`toFixed`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed) function which returns a string representation of a Number guaranteeing a precision of 1 digit after the decimal. For example, a rating of 3, 2.99, or 3.03 should all be formatted and displayed as 3.0, and a rating of 4.5 should be formatted and displayed as 4.5.

```javascript
let averageRating = 3.01; // or 2.99 or 3.03
let formattedRating = averageRating.toFixed(1); // "3.0"
```

* If the Home button on the upper-right is clicked the `#single-book` section should be hidden and the `#all-books` section should be displayed with all of the books still shown. You may assume that the list of books won't change between visits to the `#all-books` view, and thus you should *not* make unnecessary requests to the server when showing this view.

* All fetch calls in `bestreads.js` should catch any possible errors returned by bestreads API. You may use `async`/`await` in your client-side JS as an alternative to the Promise `.then` chain, but must catch errors with the `try`/`catch` equivalent of `.then`/`.catch`.

## Development Strategies
* We recommend developing the Node.js parts of the assignment first, as it can be hard to track down problems in client-side and server-side JS at the same time. Further, we recommend starting with defining helper functions (e.g. to process text files for returning JSON) in a separate `.js` file (e.g. `file-tester.js`) and running each with `node file-tester.js` in the command line, then use the working code with Express endpoints in `app.js`. This can be a good strategy to start with to help debug file processing in Node separate from debugging Express endpoints.
* Before using client-side JS in `bestreads.js` to test your Node.js page, consider using localhost on your browser to visit your Node.js endpoints, passing the appropriate parameters, until you are satisfied that your Node.js program is producing the correct output. Then, build your fetch calls to use the Bestreads web service to make sure you can get the correct data into your client-side `bestreads.js`. From there, use client-side JS to modify the page appropriately with the fetch results.
* Make sure to test your code on all available books in the repository. You may want to think about other edge cases, such as what your page should do if the book has only a single review, etc. You should not have code that depends on particular books or uses if/else statements to see which book to display.
* Use the CSE 154 ESLint to look for possible errors or warnings. For full credit, all your `.js` code must pass the linter with no errors. ("Warnings" are okay.)
  - The [CSE 154 ESLint](https://oxford.cs.washington.edu/cse154/jslint/) website is meant as a convenience and should yield identical results to the linter that runs when you commit but we will check the results from the commit and not the website. If you find a discrepancy between the two you are encouraged to reach out to course staff with details.

## Internal Requirements
For full credit, your page must not only match the external requirements listed above, but must also
demonstrate good use of client-side and server-side JS and overall code quality as demonstrated in class and
  detailed in the [CSE 154 Code Quality Guidelines](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/codequalityguide). We also expect you to implement relevant feedback from previous assignments. As usual, we have included some common things relevant to this assignment below.

### Overall JS
* Both JS files must pass the linter with no errors
* JS files must include `"use strict"` at the top of the file.
* If a particular literal value is used frequently, declare it as a "program constant" with `const` `IN_UPPER_CASE` and use the constant in your code.
* Utilize functions for good readability. Capture common operations as functions to keep code size and complexity from growing. You should not have any functions that are more than 30 lines of code. Keep variable scope as limited as possible.

### Server-side JS
* Your Node.js web service must follow the guidelines and conventions demonstrated in class as well as the [Node/Express](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/codequalityguide/node/#table-of-contents) section of the Code Quality Guide.
* Each response should [specify the correct content type](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/codequalityguide/node/#setting-response-headers) before sending a response (this includes the 400 and 500 error responses). Also remember that by default a response is sent as HTML, which is not the same as plain text.
* Content type headers should only be set when necessary and should never be overridden (see relevant section of Code Quality Guide [here](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/codequalityguide/node/#overwriting-headers)).
* Similar to your client-side JS, decompose your Node.js/Express API by writing smaller, more generic functions that complete one task rather than a few larger "do-everything" functions - your web service should have _at least_ one helper function defined and used for _each_ endpoint. This means that, at minimum, you should define four functions in your web service.
* Declare modules at the top of your file, using `const` and camelCasing conventions to represent values that should never change (recall this is different than a program constant such as `PORT` which should still follow `UPPER_CASE` naming conventions). Only declare modules that you use.
* Handle all file-processing errors with `try`/`catch` when using Promise-based `fs` functions or `glob` and `async`/`await` or `if`/`else` if using the callback-based version of `fs` functions.
* Prefer `async`/`await` to simplify your asynchronous code.
* Do not pass the `req` and/or `res` as arguments to helper functions. Prefer pulling out other functionality into helper functions as demonstrated in section and lecture.

### Client-side JS
* Your client-side JS must use the module pattern.
* All programatically-generated image DOM elements should be given an appropriate `alt` attribute.
* Do not use any global variables, and minimize the use of module-global variables. Do not ever
  store DOM element objects, such as those returned by the `document.getElementById` function, as
  module-global variables.
* Avoid unnecessary fetch requests to the web service - you should only make requests where needed to update DOM elements based on the expected behavior outlined in this spec. We **strongly** recommend walking through different interactions on your page with the Networks tab to see how often you are making fetch requests.
* Separate content (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JS). Your JS code should use styles and classes from the CSS when provided rather than manually setting each style property in the JS. For example, rather than setting the
`.style.display` of a DOM object to make it hidden/visible, instead, add/remove the `.hidden`
class in the provided CSS to the object's `classList`.
* Do not include any files in your final repository other than those outlined in "Starter Files and Final Deliverables".

### Documentation
* For both JS files, place a comment header in each file with your name, section, a brief description of the file.
* Use JSDoc to properly document all of your JS functions with a description of the function as well as `@param` and `@return` where necessary.
* In your Node.js file, your file header comment should provide a descriptive summary of the web service and description of all endpoints (endpoint format, parameters, response content type, and possible errors). This file comment should be more descriptive than other JS file comments since you are not providing an APIDOC.
* Each endpoint should also be briefly commented with 1-2 sentences having similar expectations of a function comment (but without `@param` or `@return`)

## Grading
A potential rubric for this assignment **might be** summarized as:  

### External Correctness (55-65%)
* Web Service (`app.js`)
   * Accesses and uses route parameters correctly
   * Correctly responds to the 4 modes (`description`, `info`, `reviews`, `books`)
   * Correctly handles request (400) and server-side (500) errors

   * Displays all book images and titles on page load
   * Displays information on single book click, including calculated overall rating
   * Home button works correctly
   * Multiple books can be viewed properly
   * Errors are handled correctly

### Internal Correctness (35-45% pts)
* Server-side JS
  * Sets response content type and error modes correctly, doesn't override headers.
  * Uses helper functions to handle different parts of the Node.js program.
  * Overall good use of the `fs`, `express`, and `glob` modules.

  * Factors redundancy in JS (e.g. toggling views, etc.)
  * All functions are clearly documented using JSDoc as described in the Code Quality Guide

### Documentation (5-10% pts)
* Descriptive file documentation as demonstrated in course provided materials
  * Client-side JS: name, date, section and descriptive summary of file
  * Server-side JS: name, date, section, descriptive summary of file and description of all endpoints (format, parameters, response content type, and possible errors) in the header comment as well as comments for each 4 endpoints.

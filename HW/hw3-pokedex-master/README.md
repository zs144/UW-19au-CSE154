# Homework 3 - Pokedex - Project Specification

## Overview
This assignment is about using **AJAX** to fetch data in text and JSON format and process it
using DOM manipulation. You will only be writing JavaScript in this assignment - HTML and CSS are
provided!

</p>

As with HW2, this assignment will have a Part A Submission and a Part B (Final) Submission so
students can get started early, make progress, and receive preliminary feedback before submitting the final version. You should not treat Part A as 50% of the assignment - it is worth only 5 of the 30 points total for HW3. You are expected to follow a similar process as HW2 for accepting and submitting both submissions, though you will not need to `git pull` any new files for Part B:

1. Click "Accept HW" button for the HW3 (Pokedex Part A) assignment
2. Clone this `hw3-pokedex-<username>` repo in your local cse154 directory (NOT within another git repository)
3. Add/commit/push your work when ready to submit for Part A checkpoint
4. Click "Turn in HW" button for the HW3 (Pokedex Part A) assignment
5. Click "Accept HW" button for the HW3 (Pokedex Part B) assignment
6. *Continue working from the same repository from the Part A checkpoint*
7. Add/commit/push your work when ready to submit for the HW3 (Pokedex Part B) assignment
8. Click "Turn in HW" button for the HW3 (Pokedex Part B) assignment

In addition to this README.md, you will be able to find the video demonstrated the expected behavior of this assignment on the course [homework page](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/19su/homework/index.html).

## Part A Requirements
For Part A, you need to turn in a version of `pokedex.js` that meets the following criteria:
1. **Main View**: For full credit you must demonstrate that you can fetch and load
the Pokemon into the Pokedex view with the correct Pokemon sprites "found".
2. **"My Card" View**: For full credit you must  demonstrate that you can populate
your player card correctly whenever a sprite with the `.found` class is selected.
3. Your code should be written with good JavaScript code quality based on previous HW feedback and
the [CSE 154 Code Quality Guidelines](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/codequalityguide/_site/).
4. Your code must pass the [CSE 154 ESLint](https://oxford.cs.washington.edu/cse154/jslint/).

## Grading for Part A
Your Part A submission will be worth 5 points and due Sunday (11/3/2019) at 11PM (**no late days will be accepted for this Part A submission**). This is so TA's can get feedback to students for you to implement in your final submission (Part B), but you should aim to finish before Sunday (Part B is quite a bit more than Part A). Any Part A submissions after the Part A deadline will not be eligible for credit.

The grading distribution for this assignment will be broken down as follows (subject to small changes):
* External Correctness: 60-70%
* Internal Correctness: 30-40%

### Background Information
In this assignment, you will implement views for a Pokedex and two Pokemon cards. *(Note: You will not need
to know anything about the Pokemon game throughout this assignment, although we hope you enjoy
having a more fun twist to your homework!)* A Pokedex is an encyclopedia (or album) of different Pokemon
species, representing each Pokemon as a small "sprite" image. In this assignment, a **Pokedex** entry (referenced
by the sprite image) will link directly to a **Pokemon card**, which is a card of information for a single Pokemon
species, containing a larger image of the Pokemon, its type and weakness information, its set of moves, health
point data, and a short description.

Each Pokemon has one of 18 types (fire, water, grass, normal, electric, fighting, psychic, fairy, dark, bug, steel,
ice, ghost, poison, flying, rock, ground, and dragon) and one weakness type (also from this set of 18 types).
Again, you don’t need to know about the strength/weakness of different types - this information will be provided
to you as needed.

Here, we will simplify things by assuming that each Pokemon has no more than 4 moves (some have fewer, but
all Pokemon have at least one move). In addition, we assume that the complete Pokedex has 151 Pokemon
(more have been added over the game’s history, but these comprise the original set of Pokemon species).

### Learning Objectives
* Continue to practice all of the CSE 154 learning objectives from previous assignments, including:
    * Carefully reading and following assignment specifications, and more broadly, webpage
specifications given visual and text-based artifacts as a design basis.
    * Reducing redundancy in your JS code while producing expected output.
    * Listening and responding to user events using JS event handlers on DOM objects.
    * Modifying your web page using JS and DOM objects.
    * Producing readable and maintainable code with unobtrusive modular JS.
    * Clearly documenting your code using JSDoc conventions as specified in the CSE 154 Code Quality
Guide.
*  Fetch plain text and JSON data from two web services using the JavaScript `fetch` API.
*  Implement toggling between view states using JavaScript and provided CSS helper classes.


### Starter Files and Final Deliverables
In this HW3 repository you will find the following starter files:

| File/folders&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    | Repository files to stay unchanged |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| `pokedex.html`     |  The HTML page for displaying a user's Pokedex and two game cards card and game data.|
| `pokedex.css`     |  The stylesheet for `pokedex.html` |

Your repository should be submitted with these (**unchanged**) starter files as
well as the following files you are to implement:

| File          | Repository file you will implement and turn in |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| `pokedex.js`  | JS file for managing game UI and behavior |

Your solution will be graded only on `pokedex.js` - any changes you
make to `pokedex.html` or `pokedex.css` will not be eligible for full credit.

### Image Paths
Your JS will retrieve image names for different images on the page, depending on the current
Pokemon card(s) in view and the populated Pokedex. You should use absolute paths to display any
image files, **prepending the url https<nolink>://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/webservices/pokedex/</nolink>**
to any of the necessary image directories as follows:

| Folders&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    | Image directory |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| `icons/`     |  `.jpg` icons for types, weaknesses, `.png` icons for buffs, and `.gif` icon for loading animation |
| `images/`    |  `.jpg` card images for the 151 Pokemon |
| `sprites/`  | `.png` sprite images for the 151 Pokemon |


### API Data
You will use JavaScript and AJAX requests to update `pokedex.html` as needed. Your program will
read data from the following two web services we have provided for the assignment:

* https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/webservices/pokedex/pokedex.php
* https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/webservices/pokedex/game.php

We have provided
[documentation](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/webservices/pokedex/docs/) for each
of these APIs. You will need to read through this documentation in order to use the APIs properly for
this assignment. You may assume that the data returned from both of these web services follows the
formats given.

## External Requirements
Your webpage should match the overall appearance/behavior of the provided screenshots and
it **must** match the appearance/behavior specified in this document.

### Part I: Main View
The provided HTML and CSS files display the main view by default when the page
is loaded. Below is an example of this template:

<img src="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/19su/homework/hw3/screenshots/skel-view.png" width="60%" alt="Skeleton view">

For the first part of this assignment, you will populate the right container (`#pokedex-view`)
with all 151 Pokemon sprite icons by making an AJAX `GET` request to `pokedex.php?pokedex=all`.
You should also initialize your current "found" Pokemon in your JS file with the three default starter Pokemon: Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. Throughout the game, you will have the
chance to collect Pokemon to add to your collection. Below is an image of the expected output (just
displaying the `#pokedex-view`) when the Pokedex has been populated:

<img src="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/19su/homework/hw3/screenshots/pokedex-view.png" width="60%" alt="Pokedex view">


All 151 `img`s added to the `#pokedex-view` should have a class of `.sprite` and have
their `src` attribute set to the absolute image path based on the shortname returned in
the plain text response (see Query 1 details in API documentation). You may find it helpful to save the shortname as a module-global variable. As mentioned in the
**Image Paths** section of this spec, you will need to prepend the absolute path
https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/webservices/pokedex/sprites/
to the `src` to correctly link the corresponding sprite image and append ".png" as the file extension with the shortname. By default, all images
with the `.sprite` class will show up as black shadows until they have the additional
`.found` class added (implemented in the provided CSS), which will add color to the
respective sprite image. Remember to give all `img` created in JS a descriptive `alt` text.

For each "found" sprite added to the `#pokedex-view` during the game, you will need to
add the `.found` class as well as an event handler so that when the sprite is clicked,
the card on the left is populated with that Pokemon's data. You will retrieve this data
using the `pokedex.php?pokemon=parameter` request, passing the clicked Pokemon's shortname as
the parameter. You may find it helpful to give each sprite an id with the
second "shorthand" name token in the API response, which handles special characters such as spaces
in a few Pokemon names (e.g. "mr-mime" is the shorthand name for "Mr. Mime"). For each Pokemon, the shortname represented in the pokedex.php response is the same that is returned by game.php responses. See the API documentation for more details.
If a Pokemon sprite without the class `.found` class clicked, nothing should happen.

### Left "P1 Card" View
<img src="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/19su/homework/hw3/screenshots/bulbasaur-card.png" width="30%" alt="Bulbasaur card">

Once a found Pokemon is clicked, the card data for that Pokemon populates the card on the left
side of the page. This card is in a div with the id of of `#p1`. You should use the
returned JSON object from the `pokedex.php?pokemon=parameter` request to populate the card
with the Pokemon's information, as explained below:

*  The `"name"` value should be used to populate the `#p1 .name` heading with the
    name of the Pokemon.
*  The `"images"` value is a collection of three relative folder paths, the first being
    photo to link to the Pokemon's photo (referenced by `#p1 .pokepic`), the second being `"typeIcon"`
    to link to the type icon of the Pokemon in the top-left corner (`#p1 .type`), and the
    third being the `"weaknessIcon"` to link to the weakness type icon of the Pokemon in the
    bottom-left corner `#p1 .weakness`). Hint: use a module-global constant for the absolute path of
    the API which can be prepended to each relative image path in the response.
*  The "hp" (health point) value should be used to populate the `#p1 .hp` span positioned at the top-right
   corner of the card. You will need to append "HP" (without any spaces) to the provided hp value, as shown in the
   example card image to the right.
*  The `"description"` value should be used to populate the card with the Pokemon's
    description. The description should be placed in the provided `#p1 .info` paragraph.
*  The `"moves"` value is an array of objects containing information about the Pokemon's moves (between 1 and 4 moves,
    depending on the Pokemon). You should populate only enough move buttons in
    `#p1 .moves` for the Pokemon's move count.
*  **If there are fewer than four moves for a Pokemon, you should set the extra buttons to have the
    class of `.hidden` so that they do not display visible on the card for that Pokemon**. Any hidden
    move buttons should be below the visible ones within in the `.moves` container. Make sure to unhide move buttons for later Pokemon as needed.
*  Each move button's `.move` span element should have its text set to the provided move
    name, and the `img` icon set to have a `src` attribute of that move's type (similar to how you
    did the type and weakness for the Pokemon). These type images will show to the left of the
    move's name.
*  If a move has a `"dp"` key, the corresponding value should be displayed in the move button's
    `.dp span` element with " DP" appended (see image to right for an example). Note the space between the number and DP. Moves should be
    displayed on the card in the order they are returned in the moves array.

Finally, you should make visible the `#start-btn` once a user has clicked any of their
found Pokemon. In other words, the button **should not be visible** until the card is populated
with a Pokemon's information.

### Part II: Game View
From the Main View (see Part I), clicking the "Choose This Pokemon" button under `#p1` should:

* Hide the `#pokedex-view` and show the second player's card (`#p2`), resulting in the view
similar to that below (in this example, "your" Pokemon is chosen as Bulbasaur, and the opponent's
Pokemon is Dratini).
  * (**Hint:** You should redunce redundancy here since you already have code to populate `#p1`)
* Show your Pokemon's HP bar (it should start full) by removing the `.hidden` class on `.hp-info`.
* Make the `#results-container` visible at this point, which will populate the center of the
page with turn results for each move made.
* Show the `#flee-btn` underneath `#p1`.
* Enable all of the visible move buttons for `#p1`. The provided `pokedex.html` comes with these
buttons having the `disabled` attribute by default - to enable a button, you should set this attribute
to `false`, and to disable, it should be reset to `true`.
* Change the heading text on the page from **Your Pokedex** to **Pokemon Battle Mode!**

<img src="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/19su/homework/hw3/screenshots/start-battle-view.png" width="50%" alt="Game view">

To initialize the game, you will need to make a `POST`
request to `game.php` with the `POST` parameters of `startgame=true` and
`mypokemon=yourpokemonsname`. This request will return the initial game state, including
data for your card and data for the opponent's card. This request will also return unique
`guid` (game ID) and `pid` (player ID) values that you should store as module-global variables in your
file  (see
[the api documentation](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/webservices/pokedex/docs/)).
These values will be necessary to play moves during the game.

You will use this game state data to populate each card
with image, stats, and move data for each Pokemon. Note that you already should have the necessary
data populated in your card, so won't necessarily need to re-populate at this point. You will need
to display your cards hidden `.buffs` div though for visibility during the game, and make
sure that your opponent's card also has their `.buffs` div visible (both will initially
start with no buffs/debuffs). Your opponent's card will be given as a random Pokemon (in the
example output image above, the random Pokemon is called Dratini), and should be populated with the
data similar to how you populated your card on the previous step. **Note that there is quite a bit of
redundancy here, so you should factor out redundant DOM manipulation code with functions as much as possible.**

#### Game Play

In the Game View, all `.move` buttons in `#p1` should stay enabled until either player wins/loses.

Each move that you make has an effect on the game state which is handled by the server. **All you need
to do to keep track of the game state is update the game with the data returned by the
`game.php` play move `POST` request**. You should make this request whenever a user
clicks on *their* Pokemon's moves during a game, and remove the `.hidden` class from the
`#loading` image to display a loading animation while the request is being processed. Below is a
screenshot of the page when a user clicks a move button on the left card and is waiting for a
request from the game.php API.

<img src="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/19su/homework/hw3/screenshots/loading-view.png" width="50%" alt="Loading view">

Once the server responds with the data successfully, this animation should become hidden again. The
returned game data includes a `results` object that provides the results of both Pokemon's moves
(which moves were played and whether they were a hit or miss) and you should display these in the
`#p1-turn-results` and `#p2-turn-results` paragraphs in the `#results-container` in the center of the
page, as shown in the above example.

There are a few changes that may result from the updated game state, each of which you need to handle:

* **Damage is dealt to your Pokemon and/or the opponent's Pokemon**: The returned game
    state provides data about the current health of both Pokemon. You should update the health bar
    (the `.health-bar` div on each card) to make its width a percentage of the max width, where
    the percentage is calculated as `current-hp / hp` using these values from the returned
    JSON. If the percentage is less than 20% (this includes 0), the health-bar should have a class of
    `.low-health` added to make it red (see image above for an example). When the health is greater
    than or equal to 20% of the total health, it should never have a `.low-health` class.
* **Buffs**:
    Some Pokemon have moves that apply "buffs" or "debuffs" to themselves or the opponent Pokemon
    (this is handled by the server's game logic).
    Each card has a `.buffs` div container where you will display the buffs. Each buff is an empty div with a
    class of either `.buff` (an up arrow meaning helpful) or `.debuff`
    (a downward arrow meaning harmful). These divs will also have one of three classes representing
    the type: attack, defense, and accuracy. Attack buffs `.attack` are represented
    as red arrows, defense buffs `.defense` are represented as blue arrows, and accuracy
    buffs `.accuracy` are represented as green arrows. The returned game
    state for each Pokemon has a `buffs` and `debuffs` array containing string values for all current
    `buffs` and `debuffs` based on the current state of the game (see the API documentation). You do not
    need to understand anything more about buffs/debuffs, but the buff containers should match what is returned from each player data response for **each** request to `game.php`. That means that you should clear the previous buffs and recreate them with every request. The order in which they appear in the
    respective card does not matter.


    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>

          <p>Example state with two of the same(red attack) debuffs</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

**Winning/Losing:** The game ends when one of the Pokemon has 0 hp points (this includes fleeing, discussed later). You should change the
message in the `h1` as "You won!" or "You lost!" depending on the results of
the game, displaying `#endgame` and hiding `#flee-btn`. You may assume that a game state will never
be returned with both Pokemon having HP values of 0. At this point, all move buttons in
`#p1` should be disabled (using the `disabled` property) so that no fetch requests are made when clicked (these buttons
will need to be re-enabled in a new game).

Below is an example output after you have won the game (due to playing the move Vine Whip). Note that Bulbasaur also has 3 attack debuffs from 3 Growl moves Doduo made earlier, and one defense buff from playing Amnesia once earlier).

<img src="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/19su/homework/hw3/screenshots/results-v2.png" width="60%" alt="Win case screenshot">

Below is an example output after you have lost the game (due to the opponent's Pokemon
winning from the last move they made, Bug Bite). Note that Bulbasaur made a move (Amnesia) before
Weedle - this corresponds to the 4th blue defense buff on Bulbasaur's card for that game:

<img src="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/19su/homework/hw3/screenshots/lose-case.png" width="60%" alt="Lose case screenshot">

The `#endgame` button will appear underneath the left card when visible.
You should display `#p1-turn-results` with the data populated in `p1-move` and
`p1-result`, but if you were the last one to make a move (e.g., your move causes P2's HP to
go to 0 before they make a move), `p2-result` and `p2-move` will be returned as `null`. Whenever
either `p2-result` or `p2-move` are returned as `null`, `#p2-turn-results` should be hidden.

When clicked, the `#endgame` button should switch back to the Pokedex View and the following should happen:

* The `#endgame` button, `#results-container`, and `#p2` should become hidden.
* The `.hp-info` and `.buffs` container for `#p1` should be hidden.
* The `#start-btn` should be re-displayed.
* Whatever Pokemon you chose most-recently should populate `#p1`, in case the user wants to use
that Pokemon again for a subsequent game.
* The heading (`h1`) text should change to **Your Pokedex**.
* The default HP value and health bar for your Pokemon should be reset in the Main View. Because you
are to update the Pokemon's current HP on the card for each move made in the game, you'll need to
have some way to have access to the original move when changing back to the Main View. You may save
the current Pokemon's original HP as a module-global variable to do so, but this value should not
change during the game mode.

If you win the game and the opponent has a Pokemon that you have
not found, you should add it to your Pokedex by adding it to your collection of found Pokemon (ie.
adding the `.found` class to the corresponding sprite icon in the Pokedex). You should also
add a click event handler to the found sprite to allow it to be chosen for another game (similar to
how you did with the three starter Pokemon).

**Fleeing:** There is a button under your card during the game labeled "Flee the Battle". "Flee" is
a move that causes you to lose the game immediately. If clicked, this should make a `POST` request to
`game.php` similar to other moves but passing a value `flee` for the `move` parameter (**Hint:** Make sure to reduce redundancy). This request
will terminate your game and declare your opponent as the winner by automatically setting your HP
to 0. You should display a message as described in the "lose case" above when your receive the
response to playing this move. Note that your Pokemon will flee immediately before the second
player makes a move, so they will not have any move results returned (you should not display any
results for Player 2, just your flee move results).

The screenshot below is an example expected output after a player clicks the flee button and updates the view
based on a successful response from `game.php`. Note that in this case, the opponent Pokemon happens
to have a single debuff (a downward red arrow on the top left of `#p2`) as well from previous
moves in the game.

<img src="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/19su/homework/hw3/screenshots/flee-case.png" width="50%" alt="Flee case screenshot">

**Handling errors:** There are a few possible error-cases that could happen when making requests to the web services, and ideally you'd want to show user-friendly error messages and disable/enable different elements appropriately. However for the scope of HW3 and consistency with grading, **you should handle error cases in the "catch" statement of a fetch call chain with `console.error` to log error information in the console as follows**:
```
... // rest of fetch pipeline
.catch(console.error);
```
Use `checkStatus` with `fetch` [shown in class](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/19su/lectures/lec12-ajax-fetch/index.html#/ajax-fetch-skeleton) to throw an Error if a response has a bad status code. As a reminder, this thrown Error will be caught in the `fetch` catch statement. Similar to using `checkStatus` in CP3, you are expected to document the provided `checkStatus` function with JSDoc.

## Some Common Issues/Helpful Reminders
As with any web application that switches views and makes different requests, there are a few edge
cases that are easy to miss. Here are a few common issues students forget to check in their final
submission (not exhaustive):
* Are all buttons on the `#p1` card disabled when the game is over? Are they re-enabled when a new
  game is in progress?
* Make sure you are not adding event listeners repeatedly. Event listeners should only be added once to reduce redundancy.
* Are there the correct number of move buttons added/shown on cards when new Pokemon are selected?
  At the time of this specification, Magikarp has one move. Try to check whether your card updates
  accordingly when Magikarp is chosen for a new game. Remember to use the Chrome debugger/Network
  tab to see what JSON you get back for each request!
* If you play a few rounds with moves that give buffs/debuffs, do both cards have the correct buffs
  as returned in the game.php response for any given round?
* If you play multiple games:
  * Is the HP value at the top-right corner updated correctly?
  * Is the health bar reset correctly?
  * Do you include the "DP" and "HP" units in the cards?
  * Are the type and weakness icons for both cards updated?
* When you beat a game, is the sprite given the correct class in the Pokedex to be colored? Can you
  select it to populate the card and start a new game?
* Are the #p1-results and #p2-results shown correctly during the end game for win/lose (including
  flee) cases?
* Is there any code you can find in your implementation that can be refactored?

## Development Strategies

**Debugging Tools**

We strongly recommend that you use the Chrome DevTools on this
assignment, or use the similar tool built into other browsers. As we've seen, this tool is useful for
showing syntax errors in your JavaScript code. You can also use it as a debugger, set breakpoints, type expressions on the
Console, and watch variables’ values. This is essential for efficient JavaScript programming.
For use with AJAX requests, we strongly recommend using the Network tab in the inspector tool so that you can test when
requests are made to a web service, and what responses you get back. **Part of your grade
will come from fetching requests only when needed** so make sure you are using this to
test for clicking different elements between different phases in the game (for example, no
requests should be made when clicking a move button in the "End Game" view).

## Internal Requirements
For full credit, your page must not only match the external requirements listed above, you must also
demonstrate that you understand what it means to write code following a set of programming standards.
This includes the following requirements:

* Your JS should maintain good code quality as demonstrated in class and
  detailed in the [CSE 154 Code Quality Guidelines](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/codequalityguide/_site/). We also expect you to implement relevant feedback from previous assignments. As usual, we have included some common things relevant to this assignment below.
* **You should be reducing redundancy throughout your code.**
* All programatically-generated image DOM elements should be given an alt tag.
* Your `.js` file must be in the module pattern and `"use strict";`
* Do not use any global variables, and minimize the use of module-global variables. Do not ever
  store DOM element objects, such as those returned by the `document.getElementById` function, as
  module-global variables. Other variables should be localized as much as possible.
* If a particular literal value is used frequently, declare it as a module-global "constant" (`const`) `IN_UPPER_CASE` and use the constant in your code.
* **Avoid unnecessary fetch requests to web services** - you should only make requests where needed to update DOM elements based on the expected behavior outlined in this spec. We **strongly** recommend walking through different interactions on your page with the Networks table to see how often you are making fetch requests.
* You should **make an extra effort to minimize redundant JavaScript code**. Capture common operations as functions to keep code size and complexity from growing. You can reduce your code size by using the `this` keyword in your event handlers. You should not have any functions that are more than 30 lines of code.
* Separate content (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JS). Your JS code should use styles and classes from the CSS when provided rather than manually setting each style property in the JS. For example, rather than setting the
`.style.display` of a DOM object to make it hidden/visible, instead, add/remove the `.hidden`
class in the provided CSS to the object's `classList`.  You may find the `classList`'s [toggle](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList#Methods) function helpful for toggling certain classes.
* Note that when you are **computing** a style property (such as width percentages), you will need to set the values in JS (make sure you understand why classes won't work easily here!)
* For full credit, your page must use valid JS and successfully pass our
  [CSE 154 ESLint](https://oxford.cs.washington.edu/cse154/jslint/) with no errors.
* Do not include any files in your final repository other than those outlined in "Starter Files and Final Deliverables".

### Documentation
Place a comment header in your JS file with your name, section, a brief description of the assignment, and the file's contents (examples have been given on previous assignments).
* You will be expected to properly document your functions in `pokedex.js` using JSDoc with `@param` and `@return` where necessary. Refer to the [Code Quality Guide](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/codequalityguide/_site/javascript/#comments-function-header) for some examples.

## Grading for Part B (Final Submission)
The final submission of this assignment will be out of 25 points. The key areas we will be looking at assess directly relate
to the learning objectives, and your matching the specification for the external behavior as well as
the internal correctness of your code. The grading distribution for Part B will be broken down as follows (subject to small changes):

### External Correctness (60-65%)
*  Pokedex view appears correctly and all sprites load properly with starter Pokemon visible and others not.
* Card displays correctly with the type, name, description, HP, weakness, start button. The moves
list has the correct number of moves.
*  Battle mode view - Transition works, new game, game mechanics including buffs, healthbars and
results all work correctly.
*  Battle end works - winning/losing or fleeing, and the game transitions back to the Pokedex.

### Internal Correctness (35-40%)
* Demonstrating the correct use of JavaScript, such as:
  * Passes the [CSE 154 ESLint](https://oxford.cs.washington.edu/cse154/jslint/) and follows the [CSE 154 Code Quality Guidelines](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/codequalityguide/_site/).
  * Demonstrates appropriate use of AJAX with `fetch`
  * Demonstrates appropriate use of JSON
  * No globals (module pattern); minimizes module-globals; uses variables well
  * Factors redundancy in JS (e.g. toggling views, playing moves, etc.)
* Otherwise good quality code - a catch all for things like indentation, good identifier names,
long lines, large anonymous functions, etc.

### Documentation (4-6%)
* Includes a file comment with student name, date, and section as well as a brief (2-3 sentence) overview of the file
* All functions are clearly documented using JSDoc as described in the Code Quality Guide

## Academic Integrity
As with other CSE 154 HW assignments, you may not work with other students on HW3, and all work must be your own. Submissions found sharing code or using code from resources online will be subject to the University's Academic Misconduct process. You may also not place your solution to a publicly-accessible web
site, neither during nor after the school quarter is over. Doing so is considered a violation of our
course [academic integrity](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/19su/syllabus/syllabus.html#academic-conduct)
policy. As a reminder: This page page states:

  The Paul G Allen School has an entire page on
  [Academic Misconduct](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/misconduct) within the context of
  Computer Science, and the University of Washington has an entire page on how
  [Academic Misconduct](https://www.washington.edu/cssc/for-students/academic-misconduct/) is
  handled on their
  [Community Standards and Student Conduct](https://www.washington.edu/cssc/) Page. Please acquaint
  yourself with both of those pages, and in particular how academic misconduct will be reported to
  the University.

          But they do not know the power of a Debug Dog. Particularly Mowgli the Debug Dog.

          As Douglas Adams once said, "One is never alone with a rubber duck." Mowgli
          the Debug Dog is far from a patient listener, but still will help you solve
          your debugging woes. Unlike a rubber duck, Mowgli is cuddly and goofy, doubling
          as your entertainment for the occasional times you need a break from your
          work (use with caution).

I remember the first time I met Mowgli. He looked so goofy as he stared at the code with me.
I slowly explained everything and he sort of listened to my every word. The pauses were
uncomfortable, but then I SAW it. I saw the error. Mowgli saved me hours of anguish!

Hi, I'm Mowgli! People call me Mowgs, Lil Potato, Cookies n' Cream, and everything in between.
I'm here to help you with your homework! (Just don't let me get too close to it, or I might try to
